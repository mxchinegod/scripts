# scripts
Engineering toolbox for MacOS

## Usage

I start with `/macos/coldbrew.sh` 
[https://github.com/DylanAlloy/scripts/blob/main/macos/coldbrew.sh](link)

which installs:

- `brew`
- `zsh`
- `oh-my-zsh`
- `iterm2`
- `starship` theme for iTerm2
- Hack Nerd font
- `raycast`
- `neofetch`
- `visual-studio-code`

& includes a .json document for manually importing into iTerm2 settings which will set terminal colors, window appearance, and font for you.

It will also add development-related apps on your MacOS Dock & restart
